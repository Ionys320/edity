# Edity

A responsive markdown editor.

## Informations

- Flutter is the used framwork for this project.
- Currently, this project is Web-only, but Android support can simply be added by making `flutter create . --android` 
Note that some texts should be changed.
- Windows support would need a little adaptation with the file_picker's package.

The editor is not perfect, especialy the toolbar (with bold, italic, etc).

P.S : This file was made with and for Edity =^-^=
